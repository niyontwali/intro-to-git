# Introduction to Git
- git init - initialize a repo
- git add . - add to stage area(waiting to be commited)
- git commit -m "resolve an error in the login"
- git log - logging the commits made
- git status - status of your git project
- git branch - show all branches
- git branch name_of_branch - creates a branch
- git branch -M new_name_of_branch - renames a branch

# Work flow
1. initial a project `git init`: **This is done once**
2. stage your changes `git add .`
3. commit your changes `git commit -m "descriptive text of what was changed"
4. push your commited changes
